# Stendig Calendar

This beautiful and exquisitely produced calendar was designed in 1966 by **Massimo Vignelli** and taken that year into the *Design collection* of the [Museum of Modern Art](https://www.moma.org) in New York. After 46 years, a design from the sixties endures as an example of excellence in modern graphic design.

This is a small tribute to this beautiful calendar, so you can have a digital version of it, when you can't have an original copy at home or office.

**Note:** This version is configured to work as a **PWA** for **iOS**.
